# Blockflow
A set of smart contracts with corresponding python wrappers for creating blockchain-based protocols dealing with cashflow commitments and their eventual cashflows.

## Vision

The world has many scenarios when two or more actors arrange commitments to send sets of one or more cashflows to one and other.  

### Examples

* An invoice
* Funding a startup
* Friends paying road-trip
* The procurement part of an EPC contract
* Any form of pension plan (DB, DC, CDC, etc.)
* Your kid's allowance
* Your own saving plan

This repository is going to work through building an associated abstraction and potential standard for what a token-less approach might look like for a form of open credit and triple entry accounting.  This is going to take some time.

## Tentative Plan

1.0 Write Smart Contracts on one popular public blockchains
- [ ] Choose a blockchain
- [ ] Write SCs
2.0 Create associated wrapper library, with first chain
3.0 Write Smart Contracts on a 2nd popular public blockchain
- [ ] Choose a blockchain
- [ ] Write SCs
4.0 Create associated wrapper library, with second chain
5.0 Create a hypothetical generalized wrapper for both.
6.0 Write Smart Contracts on a 3rd popular public blockchain
- [ ] Choose a blockchain
- [ ] Write SCs
7.0 Refactor the API across all 3 blockchains
